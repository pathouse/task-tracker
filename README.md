NOTE: 
This was a project I did when I was first learning how to code - before I knew anything about anything. I like keeping it around as a reminder of what it's like to be totally new at something. 


task-tracker
============

My first project of any scale in Ruby and my first programming project of any scale in about a year. Rudimentary beginnings of some sort of progress tracking application. 


Control
-------

Currently I control everything through the command line using cp.rb

I'm using the Firefox extension [Auto Reload][2] to automatically update my browser when any changes are made to the local file I have open. 

Next Steps
----------

1. Ability to add new tasks
2. Area for completed tasks w/ collapsible activity descriptions


Screenshots
-----------

Can be found in the screenshots folder.
